Iran,1979,0.66,"16,179",2,0.38,4,45,in the name of allah the compassionate the merciful we sent aforetime our apostles with clear signs and sent down with them the book and the balance that men may uphold justice the constitution of the islamic republic of iran sets forth the cultural social political and economic institutions of iranian society on the basis of islamic principles and norms which represent the earnest aspiration of the islamic ummah this basic aspiration was made explicit by the very nature of the great islamic revolution of iran as well as the course of the muslim peoples struggle from its beginning until victory as reflected in the decisive and forceful slogans raised by all segments of the populations now at the threshold of this great victory our nation with all its being seeks its fulfilment the basic characteristic of this revolution which distinguishes it from other movements that have taken place in iran during the past hundred years is its ideological and islamic nature after experiencing the antidespotic constitutional movement and the anticolonialist movement centred on the nationalization of the oil industry the muslim people of iran learned from this costly experience that the obvious and fundamental reason for the failure of those movements was their lack of an ideological basis although the islamic line of thought and the direction provided by militant religious leaders played an essential role in the recent movements nonetheless the struggles waged in the course of those movements quickly fell into stagnation due to departure from genuine islamic positions thus it was that the awakened conscience of the nation under the leadership of the eminent marji altaqlid ayatullah aluzma imam khumaynî came to perceive the necessity of pursuing an authentically islamic and ideological line in its struggles and this time the militant ulama of the country who had always been in the forefront of popular movements together with the committed writers and intellectuals found new impetus by following his leadership the beginning of the most recent movement of the iranian people is to be put at of the lunar islamic calendar corresponding to of the solar islamic calendar of the christian calendar the dawn of the movementthe devastating protest of imam khumaynî against the american conspiracy known as the quotwhite revolutionquot which was a step intended to stabilize the foundations of despotic rule and to reinforce the political cultural and economic dependence of iran on world imperialism brought into being a united movement of the people and immediately afterwards a momentous revolution of the muslim nation in the month of khurdad june although this revolution was drowned in blood in reality it heralded the beginning of the blossoming of a glorious and massive uprising which confirmed the central role of imam khumaynî as an islamic leader despite his exile from iran after his protest against the humiliating law of capitulation which provided legal immunity for american advisers the firm bond between the imam and the people endured and the muslim nation particularly committed intellectuals and militant ulama continued their struggle in the face of banishment and imprisonment torture and execution throughout this time the conscious and responsible segment of society was bringing enlightenment to the people from the strongholds of the mosques centres of religious teaching and universities drawing inspiration from the revolutionary and fertile teachings of islam they began the unrelenting yet fruitful struggle of raising the level of ideological awareness and revolutionary consciousness of the muslim people the despotic regime which had begun the suppression of the islamic movement with barbaric attacks on the faydiyyah madrasah tehran university and all other active centres of revolution in an effort to evade the revolutionary anger of the people resorted to the most savage and brutal measures and in these circumstances execution by firing squads endurance of medieval tortures and long terms of imprisonment were the price our muslim nation had to pay to prove its firm resolve to continue the struggle the islamic revolution of iran was nurtured by the blood of hundreds of young men and women infused with faith who raised their cries of quotallahu akbarquot at daybreak in execution yards or were gunned down by the enemy in streets and marketplaces meanwhile the continuing declarations and messages of the imam that were issued on various occasions extended and deepened the consciousness and determination of the muslim nation to the utmost islamic governmentthe plan of the islamic government based upon wilayat alfaqih as proposed by imam khumaynî at the height of the period of repression and strangulation practised by the despotic regime produced a new specific and streamlined motive for the muslim people opening up before them the true path of islamic ideological struggle and giving greater intensity to the struggle of militant and committed muslims both within the country and abroad the movement continued on this course until finally popular dissatisfaction and intense rage of the public caused by the constantly increasing repression at home and the projection of the struggle at the international level after exposure of the regime by the ulama and militant students shook the foundations of the regime violently the regime and its sponsors were compelled to decrease the intensity of repression and to quotliberalizequot the political atmosphere of the country this they imagined will serve as a safety valve which would prevent their eventual downfall but the people aroused conscious and resolute under the decisive and unfaltering leadership of the imam embarked on a triumphant unified comprehensive and countrywide uprising the wrath of the peoplethe publication of an outrageous article meant to malign the revered ulama and in particular imam khumaynî on day january by the ruling regime accelerated the revolutionary movement and caused an outburst of popular outrage across the country the regime attempted to quell the volcano of the peoples anger by drowning the protest and uprising in blood but the bloodshed only quickened the pulse rate of the revolution the seventhday and fortiethday commemorations of the martyrs of the revolution like a series of steady heartbeats gave greater vitality intensity vigour and solidarity to this movement all over the country in the course of this popular movement the employees of all government establishments took an active part in the effort to overthrow the tyrannical regime by calling a general strike and participating in street demonstrations the widespread solidarity of men and women of all segments of society and of all political and religious factions played a clearly determining role in the struggle especially the women were actively and massively present in a most conspicuous manner at all stages of this great struggle the common sight of mothers with infants in their arms rushing towards the scene of battle and in front of the barrels of machineguns indicated the essential and decisive role played by this major segment of society in the struggle the price the nation paidafter slightly more than a year of continuous and unrelenting struggle the sapling of the revolution watered by the blood of more than martyrs and wounded and disabled not to mention billions of tumans worth of property damage came to bear fruit amidst the cries of quotindependence freedom islamic governmentquot this great movement which attained victory through reliance upon faith unity and the decisiveness of its leadership at every critical and sensitive juncture as well as the selfsacrificing spirit of the people succeeded in upsetting all the calculations of imperialism and destroying all its connections and institutions thereby opening a new chapter in the history of all embracing popular revolutions of the world bahman and february and witnessed the collapse of the monarchical regime domestic tyranny and foreign domination both of which were based upon it were shattered this great success proved to be the vanguard of islamic governmenta longcherished desire of the muslim peopleand brought with it the glad tidings of final victory

to bring about a new political system that of the islamic republic a majority of the people voted for this system the constitution of the islamic republic of iran setting forth as it does the political social cultural and economic institutions and their relations that are to exist in society must now provide for the consolidation of the foundations of islamic government and propose the plan of a new system of government to be erected on the ruins of the previous taghuti order the form of government in islamin the view of islam government does not derive from the interests of a class nor does it serve the domination of an individual or a group it represents rather the crystallization of the political ideal of a people who bear a common faith and common outlook taking an organized form in order to initiate the process of intellectual and ideological evolution towards the final goal ie movement towards allah our nation in the course of its revolutionary developments has cleansed itself of the dust and impurities that accumulated during the taghuti past and purged itself of foreign ideological influences returning to authentic intellectual standpoints and worldview of islam it now intends to establish an ideal and model society on the basis of islamic norms the mission of the constitution is to realize the ideological objectives of the movement and to create conditions conducive to the development of man in accordance with the noble and universal values of islam with due attention to the islamic content of the iranian revolution which has been a movement aimed at the triumph of all the mustadafun over the mustakbirun the constitution provides the necessary basis for ensuring the continuation of the revolution at home and abroad in particular in the development of international relations the constitution will strive with other islamic and popular movements to prepare the way for the formation of a single world community in accordance with the quranic verse quotthis your community is a single community and i am your lord so worship mequot and to assure the continuation of the struggle for the liberation of all deprived and oppressed peoples in the world with due attention to the essential character of this great movement the constitution guarantees the rejection of all forms of intellectual and social tyranny and economic monopoly and aims at entrusting the destinies of the people to the people themselves in order to break completely with the system of oppression this is in accordance with the quranic verse quothe removes from them their burdens and the fetters that were upon themquot in creating on the basis of ideological outlook the political infrastructures and institutions that are the foundation of society the righteous will assume the responsibility of governing and administering the country in accordance with the quranic verse quotverily my righteous servants shall inherit the earthquot legislation setting forth regulations for the administration of society will revolve around the quran and the sunnah accordingly the exercise of meticulous and earnest supervision by just pious and committed scholars of islam alfuqaha aludul is an absolute necessity in addition the aim of government is to foster the growth of man in such a way that he progresses towards the establishment of a divine order in accordance with the quranic phrase quotand toward god is the journeyingquot and to create favourable conditions for the emergence and blossoming of mans innate capacities so that the theomorphic dimensions of the human being are manifested in accordance with the injunction of the prophet s quotmould yourselves according to the divine moralityquot this goal cannot be attained without the active and broad participation of all segments of society in the process of social development with due attention to this goal the constitution provides the basis of such participation by all members of society at all stages of the political decisionmaking process on which the destiny of the country depends in this way during the course of human development towards perfection each individual will himself be involved in and responsible for the growth advancement and leadership of society precisely in this lies the realization of the government of the mustadafun upon the earth in accordance with the quranic verse quotand we wish to show favour to those who have been oppressed upon earth and to make them leaders and the inheritorsquot the wilayah of the just faqihin keeping with the principles of governance wilayat alamr and the perpetual necessity of leadership imamah the constitution provides for the establishment of leadership by a faqih possessing the necessary qualifications jami alsharait and recognized as leader by the people this is in accordance with the hadith quotthe direction of public affairs is in the hands of those who are learned concerning god and are trustworthy in matters pertaining to what he permits and forbidsquot tuhaf aluqul p such leadership will prevent any deviation by the various organs of state from their essential islamic duties the economy is a means not an endin strengthening the foundations of the economy the fundamental consideration will be fulfillment of the material needs of man in the course of his overall growth and development this principle contrasts with other economic systems where the aim is concentration and accumulation of wealth and maximization of profit in materialist schools of thought the economy represents an end in itself so that it comes to be a subversive and corrupting factor in the course of mans development in islam the economy is a means and all that is required of a means is that it should be an efficient factor contributing to the attainment of the ultimate goal from this viewpoint the economic programme of islam consists of providing the means needed for the emergence of the various creative capacities of the human being accordingly it is the duty of the islamic government to furnish all citizens with equal and appropriate opportunities to provide them with work and to satisfy their essential needs so that the course of their progress may be assured woman in the constitutionthrough the creation of islamic social infrastructures all the elements of humanity that hitherto served the multifaceted foreign exploitation shall regain their true identity and human rights as a part of this process it is only natural that women should benefit from a particularly large augmentation of their rights because of the greater oppression that they suffered under the taghuti regime the family is the fundamental unit of society and the main centre for the growth and edification of human being compatibility with respect to belief and ideal which provides the primary basis for mans development and growth is the main consideration in the establishment of a family it is the duty of the islamic government to provide the necessary facilities for the attainment of this goal this view of the family unit delivers woman from being regarded as an object or as an instrument in the service of promoting consumerism and exploitation not only does woman recover thereby her momentous and precious function of motherhood rearing of ideologically committed human beings she also assumes a pioneering social role and becomes the fellow struggler of man in all vital areas of life given the weighty responsibilities that woman thus assumes she is accorded in islam great value and nobility an ideological armyin the formation and equipping of the countrys defence forces due attention must be paid to faith and ideology as the basic criteria accordingly the army of the islamic republic of iran and the islamic revolutionary guards corps are to be organized in conformity with this goal and they will be responsible not only for guarding and preserving the frontiers of the country but also for fulfilling the ideological mission of jihad in gods way that is extending the sovereignty of gods law throughout the world this is in accordance with the quranic verse quotprepare against them whatever force you are able to muster and strings of horses striking fear into the enemy of god and your enemy and others besides themquot the judiciary in the constitutionthe judiciary is of vital importance in the context of safeguarding the rights of the people in accordance with the line followed by the islamic movement and the prevention of deviations within the islamic nation provision has therefore been made for the creation of a judicial system based on islamic justice and operated by just judges with meticulous knowledge of the islamic laws this system because of its essentially sensitive nature and the need for full ideological conformity must be free from every kind of unhealthy relation and connection this is in accordance with the quranic verse quotwhen you judge among the people judge with justicequot executive powerconsidering the particular importance of the executive power in implementing the laws and ordinances of islam for the sake of establishing the rule of just relations over society and considering too its vital role in paving the way for the attainment of the ultimate goal of life the executive power must work toward the creation of an islamic society consequently the confinement of the executive power within any kind of complex and inhibiting system that delays or impedes the attainment of this goal is rejected by islam therefore the system of bureaucracy the result and product of taghuti forms of government will be firmly cast away so that an executive system that functions efficiently and swiftly in the fulfilment of its administrative commitments comes into existence masscommunication mediathe masscommunication media radio and television must serve the diffusion of islamic culture in pursuit of the evolutionary course of the islamic revolution to this end the media should be used as a forum for healthy encounter of different ideas but they must strictly refrain from diffusion and propagation of destructive and antiislamic practices it is incumbent on all to adhere to the principles of this constitution for it regards as its highest aim the freedom and dignity of the human race and provides for the growth and development of the human being it is also necessary that the muslim people should participate actively in the construction of islamic society by selecting competent and believing mumin officials and keeping close and constant watch on their performance they may then hope for success in building an ideal islamic society that can be a model for all people of the world and a witness to its perfection in accordance with the quranic verse quotthus we made you a median community that you might be witnesses to menquot representativesthe assembly of experts composed of representatives of the people completed its task of framing the constitution on the basis of the draft proposed by the government as well as all the proposals received from different groups of the people in one hundred and seventyfive articles arranged in twelve chapters on the eve of the fifteenth century after the migration of the holy prophet peace and blessings be upon him and his family the founder of the redeeming school of islam and in accordance with the aims and aspirations set out above with the hope that this century will witness the establishment of a universal government of the mustadafun and the downfall of all the mustakbirun,0
